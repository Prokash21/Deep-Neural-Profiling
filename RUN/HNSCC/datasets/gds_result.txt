74. A prognostic signature of cell death-related genes for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
(Submitter supplied) Human papillomavirus (HPV) positive HNSCC patients generally have a favorable survival and promising responsiveness to radiotherapy, chemoradiotherapy and checkpoint blockades. However, HPV negative patients, the majority of HNSCC patients, have been largely overlooked. Cell death has been involved in the therapeutic resistance of cancers. We constructed a cell death index (CDI), based on autophagy, apoptosis and pyroptosis related genes, to predict the prognosis for HNSCC using TCGA dataset, and validated in a cohort from Qilu Hospital of Shandong University. more...

140. Integrated single cell and bulk gene expression and ATAC-seq reveals heterogeneity and early changes in pathways associated with resistance to cetuximab in HNSCC sensitive cell lines (scRNA-Seq)
(Submitter supplied) The identification of the potential mechanisms of resistance while tumor cells still respond to therapy is critical to develop combination therapies to delay acquired resistance. Cetuximab, an anti-EGFR therapy, is the only targeted therapy available for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). We generated the first comprehensive multi-omics, bulk and single cell data in sensitive HNSCC cells to identify relevant transcriptional and epigenetic changes that are an immediate response to cetuximab in sensitive cells. more...

142. RNA-Seq analyses with sorted ROSLow cells and ROSHigh cells
(Submitter supplied) Recently, CICs were shown to be relatively resistant to therapy, perhaps due to increased expression of ROS defense genes. Additionally, in our previous study, the maintenance of low ROS levels within the HN-CICs was important for regulating stemness properties and conferring chemoresistance. Herein, we exploited RNA-Seq analyses with sorted ROSLow cells versus ROSHigh cells to obtain mechanistic insights into the role of the antioxidant defense system in CICs.

145. The Influence of Met Receptor Level on HGF-Induced Glycolytic Reprogramming in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
(Submitter supplied) Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) are known to overexpress a variety of receptor tyrosine kinases, such as the HGF receptor Met. Like other malignancies, there is a mutual interaction between the tumor cells and surrounding tissues and cells. We hypothesized that activation of HGF/Met signaling in HNSCC might influence glucose metabolism and therefore substantially changes the tumor microenvironment. more...

(Submitter supplied) Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) arises from the mucosal lining of the upper aerodigestive tract and display few treatment options in advanced stages. Despite increased knowledge of HNSCC molecular biology, the identification of new players involved in triggering HNSCC recurrence and metastatic disease is needed. We uncover that G-protein-coupled receptor kinase-2 (GRK2) expression is reduced in undifferentiated, high-grade human HNSCC tumors, whereas its silencing in model human HNSCC cells is sufficient to trigger epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotypic features, an EMT-like transcriptional program and enhanced lymph node colonization from orthotopic tongue tumors in mice. more...
