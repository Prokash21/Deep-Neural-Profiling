## Abstract

**Background:**  
Early detection is critical for improving cancer prognosis, yet existing diagnostic biomarkers often lack adequate sensitivity and specificity. Advances in RNA sequencing, including **single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)**, have deepened our understanding of tumor heterogeneity. However, while computational pipelines can suggest potential biomarkers, rigorous **molecular validation** is essential to confirm their clinical relevance.

**Methods:**  
This project integrates **bioinformatic analyses** with **molecular validation**. The dry-lab phase involves data acquisition and analysis of RNA-Seq and scRNA-seq datasets, differential gene expression profiling, and machine learning-based biomarker prioritization. The wet-lab phase includes validation using human tissue samples. Histopathological examination ensures sample integrity, while DNA, RNA, and protein extractions enable validation through **qRT-PCR**, **PCR assays**, and **ELISA**. Bioinformatic tools will further investigate molecular interactions and contextualize validated biomarkers within relevant pathways.

**Expected Results:**  
The study will generate a curated list of **validated cancer-specific biomarkers**, their expression profiles, and associated molecular networks. It will also highlight key pathways underlying tumorigenesis across multiple anatomical sites.

**Conclusion:**  
By combining computational discovery with wet-lab validation, this study aims to establish highly sensitive and specific biomarkers for early cancer detection. The findings will enhance diagnostic accuracy, contribute to **precision oncology**, and ultimately improve patient outcomes.
